Machine Learning Basics

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Uses labeled data to train models
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finds patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learns through trial and error

Popular ML Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest

Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicles

Key Concepts:
- Training data
- Test data
- Overfitting
- Cross-validation
- Feature engineering
